The last 25 years have been a wild ride. I’ve both worked for big name companies and played the role of a big fish in small ponds. That time has afforded me the opportunity to work across the nation as I developed my skills, and to return to my Montgomery roots once I started adding rug rats to the mix.

I’ve been back home for more than 12 years now. In that time, I authored a book, I started a (moderately successful) LLC, I took the plunge into teaching programming to kids, and I engaged in a few open source projects (something I never thought I would do).

More importantly, I’ve established bonds with local talent that I would never have met if I hadn’t returned home. That is probably the hardest part of my decision to leave - the feeling that I’m abandoning my friends, my family.

My primary consideration in transitioning to a new company is that I’ve been stagnating in my growth as a developer. Programming is my life. But, I feel as though I’ve been coasting on my prior achievements. On February 2nd, I turned 43. It was a stark reminder that my remaining time on this rock in space is getting shorter. I’m an old dog, but I’m ready to learn new tricks!

In my new role, I’ll be taking great risks. I’ll be challenging myself. And I’ll be charting unexplored (to me) territory. The possibility of failure is very real, and I truly hope that drives me to become an even better software developer than I have in my two-and-a-half decades in the industry. The company that I’ve decided to partner with is a leader in agile and test-driven methodologies. With all my years, and all my experiences, I’ll be the newbie in my new role.

I will miss all the great folks that I've met since returning home, but I believe it’s time for a new chapter in my life.
